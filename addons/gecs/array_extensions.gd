## Intersects two arrays of entities.[br]
## In common terms, use this to find items appearing in both arrays.
## [param array1] The first array to intersect.[br]
## [param array2] The second array to intersect.[br]
## [b]return Array[/b] The intersection of the two arrays.
static func intersect(array1: Array, array2: Array) -> Array:
	# Optimize by using the smaller array for lookup
	if array1.size() > array2.size():

## Unions two arrays of entities.[br]
## In common terms, use this to combine items without duplicates.[br]
## [param array1] The first array to union.[br]
## [param array2] The second array to union.[br]
## [b]return Array[/b] The union of the two arrays.
static func union(array1: Array, array2: Array) -> Array:

## Differences two arrays of entities.[br]
## In common terms, use this to find items only in the first array.[br]
## [param array1] The first array to difference.[br]
## [param array2] The second array to difference.[br]
## [b]return Array[/b] The difference of the two arrays (entities in array1 not in array2).
static func difference(array1: Array, array2: Array) -> Array:
	# Use dictionary for O(1) lookup instead of O(n) Array.has()
